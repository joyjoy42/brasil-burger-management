## Current Page
You're on: `https://console.cloudinary.com/app/c-f69ae335080562487aac4fd53a8890/assets/media_library/folders/cd9f66d587893e744ab4737e049621f182?view_mode=mosaic`

This is the **Media Library folder view**. Now follow these exact steps:

## 📋 Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Find an Image
- On this page, you should see a grid/list of images in the `brasil-burger` folder
- Look for any image (e.g., `burger-classique.jpg`, `menu-etudiant.png`, etc.)

### Step 2: Click on an Image
- **Single-click** on any image thumbnail
- This will open the image details panel on the right side of the screen

### Step 3: Find the URL in Details Panel
After clicking an image, look at the **right-side panel** that opens. You'll see image details.

**Look for one of these fields:**

#### Option A: "URL" or "Secure URL"
- Find a field labeled **"URL"** or **"Secure URL"**
- It will show a URL like: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dbkji1d1j/image/upload/...`
- **This is the delivery URL!** Copy this.

#### Option B: "Public ID"
- Find a field labeled **"Public ID"**
- It might show something like: `brasil-burger/burger-classique` or just `burger-classique`
- If you see this, share it with me and I'll construct the URL

#### Option C: "Delivery URL" or "Image URL"
- Some Cloudinary interfaces show this directly
- Copy the URL shown

### Step 4: Alternative - Right-Click Method
If you can't find the URL in the details panel:

1. **Right-click** directly on an image thumbnail
2. Look for options like:
   - "Copy image address"
   - "Copy image URL"
   - "Copy link"
3. Select one of these options
4. This should copy the delivery URL to your clipboard

### Step 5: Verify It's the Right URL
The URL should:
- ✅ Start with `https://res.cloudinary.com/`
- ✅ Contain `/image/upload/`
- ✅ NOT start with `https://console.cloudinary.com/`
- ✅ NOT start with `https://collection.cloudinary.com/`

## 📸 What the Delivery URL Looks Like

**Correct format examples:**
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dbkji1d1j/image/upload/brasil-burger/burger-classique
https://res.cloudinary.com/dbkji1d1j/image/upload/v1234567890/brasil-burger/burger-classique
https://res.cloudinary.com/dbkji1d1j/image/upload/brasil-burger/burger-classique.jpg
```

**Wrong formats (these are NOT delivery URLs):**
```
https://console.cloudinary.com/... (dashboard URL)
https://collection.cloudinary.com/... (collection URL)
```

## 🆘 If You Still Can't Find It

If you can't find the URL field, try this:

1. **Double-click** on an image (this might open it in a new view)
2. Look for a **"Share"** or **"Copy URL"** button
3. Or check if there's a **"..." (three dots)** menu on the image
4. Look for **"Get URL"** or **"Copy URL"** in that menu

## 📝 What to Share

Once you have the delivery URL, please share:
1. The **full URL** (e.g., `https://res.cloudinary.com/dbkji1d1j/image/upload/brasil-burger/burger-classique`)
2. Or just the **Public ID** if that's what you see (e.g., `brasil-burger/burger-classique`)

**Tip:** If you're still having trouble, you can also:
- Take a screenshot of the image details panel
- Or tell me what fields you see in the details panel
